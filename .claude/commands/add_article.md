Add the article from #$ARGUMENTS (provide URL or article title) to the wiki page following the pattern in place in the wiki.html file. 

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Create a clickable title that links to the original source
- Write a 2-3 sentence introduction summarizing the key points
- Add 2-4 relevant topic tags

PLACEMENT LOGIC:
- Add to the most relevant existing section based on article content and topic
- If no existing section is appropriate (less than 70% topic overlap), create a new section. It's ok to create sections that differ from primary webisite's topics (for example, movies)
- New sections should follow the wiki's existing hierarchical structure
- Place new sections in logical order relative to existing content

CONTENT HANDLING:
- For URLs: Extract title, key points, and determine topic tags from the article content
- For article titles only: Search for the article online to gather necessary information
- If content is inaccessible (paywall, 404, etc.), note the limitation and add entry with available information

ERROR HANDLING:
- If topic is unclear, place in "Miscellaneous" section and flag for potential reorganization
- Refuse to add the article if already present in the wiki

Maintain consistency with existing wiki formatting, spacing, and organizational patterns.
